# Get these values from: Firebase Console > Project Settings > General > Your apps

# IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE:
# Firebase web API keys are DESIGNED to be public (client-side).
# Security is enforced through:
# 1. Firebase Security Rules (Firestore/Storage)
# 2. Authorized domains in Firebase Console
# 3. Optional: Firebase App Check
#
# However, using environment variables is still a best practice because:
# - Easier to manage multiple environments (dev/staging/prod)
# - Prevents accidental key rotation issues
# - Better separation of config from code
